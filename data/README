Notes on the data in this directory: 

# Data generated prior to trehalose analysis ----------------------------------#
* inputs/pan_genome_reference.fa
  inputs/gene_presence_absence.Rtab
  Roary results
  Run commands were: roary -p 8 -r -e -n -v -i 70 *.gff
  
* inputs/key.csv
  List of all of the high quality samples from the sequencing project used for trehalose paper. 

* inputs/input_tree.tree
  Phylogenetic tree of all of the samples (including samples to be excluded from the analysis due to poor sequencing quality). 
  
* inputs/SNP_matrix.csv
  Matrix of all variants from this data set (including bad samples). 
  Generated by Ali Pirani's variant calling pipeline (https://github.com/alipirani88/variant_calling_pipeline)
  
* inputs/model_variables_plus_ribo_and_id.tsv
  Information for full cohort (not just the Risk Score Matched set)

# Data generated by the trehalose analysis ------------------------------------#
* outputs/clogit_only_trehalose_variants_of_interest.tsv   
  Conditional logistic regression results for only L172I, four gene insertion, or the combined L172I, C171S, & insertion combined. Reports odds ratio, confidence interval, and P-value. 
  Generated by this script: lib/clogit.R

* outputs/descriptive_stats.txt

* outputs/imputation_descriptive_stats.txt
  Data describing the cohort that was included in imputation and logistic regression.
  Generated by this script: lib/variant_imputation.R 
  
* outputs/imputation_plus_sequenced_results_summary_logit_risk_score.tsv
  Summary of logistic regression results when run on imputed + sequenced data, risk score as a continuous variable. 
  Generated by this script: lib/variant_imputation.R 
  
* outputs/logit_with_score_imputation.tsv
