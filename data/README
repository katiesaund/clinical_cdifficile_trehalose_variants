# Data generated by/for the trehalose analysis --------------------------------#
* outputs/DATE_clogit_all_trehalose_variants.tsv
  Conditional logistic regression results for all variants in TreR and the four gene insertion. Reports odds ratio, confidence interval, and P-value.

* outputs/DATE_descriptive_stats.txt
  Description of the cohort on which the study was conducted. Includes cases vs control, ribotypes, breakdown by presence/absence of trehalose variants, etc...
  Generated by this script: ../lib/generate_cohort_stats.R

* outputs/DATE_FE_imputation_plus_sequenced_results.tsv
  Results of the Fisher's Exact test (Severe_Outcome vs Presence/absence of the combined C171S/L172I/Four gene insertion variants) on the real data supplemented with imputed data.
